# spartan

## About
Spartan is a simple OS built in Rust to learn Rust and to learn principles of Operating Systems. I plan to use this as a testing ground for different operating system ideas  to showcase my understanding and get experience with implementing OS features in a new systems language. Rust is my goto choice for its zero-cost abstractions, speed, reliability, and memory saftey model. I will be taking an bare metal OS class soon, and plan to try and port a lot of what i build there into this OS environment.
